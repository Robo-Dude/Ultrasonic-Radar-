# Ultrasonic-Radar-
Ultrasonic Sensor Radar. In this project, I will show you how to design a simple Radar Application using Arduino and Processing. This Arduino Radar Project is implemented with the help of Processing Application. Radar is a long-range object detection system that uses radio waves to establish certain parameters of an object like its range, speed and position. Radar technology is used in aircrafts, missiles, marine, weather predictions and automobiles.
